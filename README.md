## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI (Radix UI primitives)
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useMemo, useCallback)

## Development Rules

### Component Organization
- **Ledger Components** (`src/components/ledger/`): Core data display components like PlayerGrid, VoteLedger, DeathLedger
- **Pickers** (`src/components/pickers/`): Interactive selection components (RotaryPicker, ClockPicker)
- **Tabs** (`src/components/tabs/`): Content components for each main tab
- **UI Components** (`src/components/popitems/`): Reusable UI elements, popups, and overlays

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes exclusively
- Maintain the "dark/slate" aesthetic for headers and sidebars
- Ensure mobile-responsive design with Tailwind's responsive prefixes
- Keep components small and focused (under 100 lines where possible)

### Best Practices
- Use toasts for important user feedback
- Avoid try/catch blocks for general logic to allow errors to bubble up
- Keep the "Ledger" aesthetic: compact, high-density information, and monospaced fonts for numerical data

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

- Use the day controls to navigate through game days
- Enable assignment modes (Death or Property) to quickly assign reasons or properties to players
- Add nominations and deaths using the FAB (Floating Action Button)
- Track voting patterns with the interactive vote ledger and drag-and-drop
- Manage roles and distributions in the Roles tab, with role update popup for bulk changes
- Keep notes for social reads and observations
- Adjust font size via the FAB for better readability
- Export data when needed
